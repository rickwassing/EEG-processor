function [output, errorMess] = butterFiltZPLowPassFiltFilt(input, Fpass, Fs, filterOrder)
% Lowpass Butterworth IIR filter.
% Filter constructed using butterworth
% Filter constructed with zero-pole-gain from  
% converted into a second order section (SOS)
% and the non-linear phase is corrected by the filtfilt.
%
% Input: 
%   input       : EEG timeseries, tall vector
%   Fpass       : cut off frequency (last frequency to pass)
%   Fs          : frequency sampling
%   filterOrder : (optional) the order of the filter (default is 10)
%
% Output:
%   output    : the filtered EEG signal, tall vector.
%   errorMess : cell of string, empty if everyting is ok
